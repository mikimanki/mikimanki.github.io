  <h1>Privacy Policy for MeloTask</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 2025</p>
  <p><strong>MeloTask (“the App”) respects users' privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how MeloTask handles users' information.</strong></p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>MeloTask does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data from users.</p>
  <p>Voice input is used only to create reminders. Recordings are processed locally on users' devices and are never uploaded or sent to any server.</p>
  <p>All reminders and related data are stored in a local database on the users' devices only.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
  <p>All data stays on the users' devices.</p>
  <p>When a user deletes a reminder, it is permanently removed from the local database with no backup or cloud storage.</p>
  <p>MeloTask does not provide an export option.</p>

  <h2>Payments and Subscription</h2>
  <p>MeloTask offers a free 14-day trial, after which users can subscribe via Google Play Billing ($2/month or $20/year).</p>
  <p>The App checks with Google Play to verify trial status and subscription purchases.</p>
  <p>MeloTask does not store or have access to users' payment information; all transactions are handled securely by Google Play.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>MeloTask does not share any user data with third parties.</p>
  <p>No analytics, advertising, or tracking tools are used.</p>

  <h2>Users' Rights</h2>
  <p>Since MeloTask does not collect or store users' personal data, there is no personal information to access, export, or request deletion of. All reminder data is entirely under users' control on their devices.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy if necessary. Any changes will be reflected within the App or on its official listing page.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer at:
